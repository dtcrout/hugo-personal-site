I'm interested in the [gear other people use](https://usesthis.com/) to get their work done.
If you're at all curious, here's my personal setup:

### Lenovo ThinkPad x220

The xx20 ThinkPad series is the last one to have the classical keyboard. I use this computer as my daily driver. I run Ubuntu LTS as my primary OS, switching between different window managers. For development I use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) and [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/). My dotfiles are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/dtcrout/dotfiles). For additional productivity, I use the [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/) Chrome extension which brings Vim controls to the browser.

### Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2 + Hasu BT Controller

The Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2 is a Japanese keyboard with a 60% layout and [Topre](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Topre_switch) switches. It's portable and extremely pleasant to type on (as well as listen to). The layout differs from traditional keyboards as the Esc and Backspace keys are shifted down one row. The Ctrl keys are removed from their usual position. Instead the Caps Lock key is remapped as Ctrl. This makes the keyboard ergonomic and Emacs key bindings much easier to use.

The keyboard has the [Hasu Bluetooth Controller](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=71517.0) installed which makes it wireless and fully programmable.
