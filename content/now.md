## Projects üë®‚Äçüíª

* **[ October 13, 2019 ]** The mouse, trackpad and arrow keys are hot lava! üñ±Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏èüî•I wrote a [post](/post/speed-up-your-workflow-the-evil-way) on how Vim and Emacs shortcuts can be used in the browser and macOS
* **[ September 26, 2019 ]** I wrote some reflections on my journey into open source software development. I learned that it's not just about writting code. I can be about teaching too. Post [here](/post/meditations-on-first-contributions)
* **[ September 20, 2019 ]** I wrote some steps you can take to prevent data leakage in your next data science or machine learning project. Post [here](/post/prevent-data-leakage-in-your-data-science-project)
* **[ August 28, 2019 ]** Porting code is a forensic endeavour. Throughout the horrible experience I learned the _handiness_ of Makefiles. Post about it [here](/post/make-life-easier-with-makefiles)
* **[ August 7, 2019 ]** I contributed to [freshscript](https://github.com/amcquade/fresh_script/pull/55/files) by making a module which loads a credentials file
* **[ July 5, 2019 ]** I recently read a paper called [CNM: An Interpretable Complex-valued Network for Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05298) and I was not satisfied with the author's use of physics. Instead of falling into nihilistic despair, I decided to [write about it](/post/big-trouble-in-little-quanta)
* **[ June 1, 2019 ]** Spotitude is now a web app: https://spotitude.me/. Look at your top tracks on different time ranges and create a playlist. Made with Vue.js. Code found [here](https://github.com/dtcrout/spotitude-webapp)
* **[ May 31, 2019 ]** I'm participating in a joint collaboration by the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and people from other industries to recreate SOTA language models
* **[ May 26, 2019 ]** Frustrated about how Spotify doesn't provide their users with their analytics, I created a tool called Spotitude which displays a user's top 25 tracks. Code found [here](https://github.com/dtcrout/spotitude)
* **[ May 11, 2019 ]** I made an image captioning generation model to generate YouTube thumbnail titles. Write up can be found [here](/post/generating-youtube-titles-using-image-captioning/) and code [here](https://github.com/dtcrout/yt-title-generator)
* **[ Jan 27, 2019 ]** I switched my site over to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and wrote a blog post about it [here](/post/building-a-site-using-hugo)
