### Books

#### Currently Reading
* [Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981-1991, by Michael Azerrad](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316787531/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_JkHyCbX5MYAPG)

### Projects

* **[June 1, 2019]** Spotitude is now a web app: https://spotitude.me/. Look at your top tracks on different time ranges and create a playlist. Made with Vue.js. Code found [here](https://github.com/dtcrout/spotitude-webapp)
* **[ May 26, 2019 ]** Frustrated about how Spotify doesn't provide their users with their analytics, I created a tool called Spotitude which displays a user's top 25 tracks. Code found [here](https://github.com/dtcrout/spotitude)
* **[ May 11, 2019 ]** I made an image captioning generation model to generate YouTube thumbnail titles. Write up can be found [here](/post/generating-youtube-titles-using-image-captioning/) and code [here](https://github.com/dtcrout/yt-title-generator)
* **[ Jan 27, 2019 ]** I switched my site over to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and wrote a blog post about it [here](/post/building-a-site-using-hugo)
