Hello, my name is Darshan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a data scientist at CBC/Radio-Canada based in Toronto, Ontario. Previously I worked as a data scientist at Scotiabank. I have a MSc in Computer Science and BSc in Physics.

During my undergrad, I got involved in mathematical models for biological aggregation and opinion dynamics in which I solved differential equations using Monte Carlo methods. This got me interested in big data problems in addition to the field of machine learning. Naturally loving math and problem solving, I enrolled in the [Professional Master's program in Big Data](https://www.sfu.ca/bigdata) at Simon Fraser University. There I gained [the skills necessary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bJOuFC4KPI) to pursue a career in data science. When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, listening to music or training for my next triathlon.
